# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
This repository contains the files for NaiveBayesClassifier project done for the Artificial intelligence course comp-472 offered by Concordia University(Montreal, Canada)

## Description 
In this project a probabilistic model was built from a set of training data and experimented with different constraints. The data was taken from Hacker News fetched from Kaggle. The sentences from the title of the data were tokenized. In the training process we use frequencies of the words and probabilities of occurences with respect to the data points. In the baseline experiment it predicts the data point whether it is right or wrong. In the following three experiments the mentioned constraints were added and the above experiments were repeated again. 
- Stop word filtering 
- Word length filtering
- Infrequent Word filtering
