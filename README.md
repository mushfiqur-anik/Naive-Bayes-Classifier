# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
This repository contains the files for NaiveBayesClassifier project done for the Artificial intelligence course comp-472 offered by Concordia University(Montreal, Canada)

## Description 
In this project a probabilistic model was built from a set of training data and experimented with different constraints. The words were tokenized from the title . The sentences from the title of the data were tokenized. In the training process we use frequencies of the words and probabilities of occurences with respect to the data points. In the baseline experiment it predicts the data point whether it is right or wrong. In the following three experiments the mentioned constraints were added and the above experiments were repeated again. 
- Stop word filtering 
- Word length filtering
- Infrequent Word filtering


In this project a probabilistic model was built (The model correctly classifies which post type (story, ask_hn, show_hn, poll) the selected word belongs to). 

The dataset contains Hacker News posts from 2018-2019 and each post includes the following columns: 
(Object ID | Title | Post Type | Author | Created At | URL | Points | Number of Comments | year) 

- calculate score using log 10

The purpose of this project was to learn and apply the concepts of Natural Language Processing(NPL) & Machine Learning(ML). In this project a dataset (Dataset of Kaggle taken from kaggle) was provided and it consisted of posts from users from year 2018-19. 
Each post includes the following columns: 
- (Object ID | Title | Post Type | Author | Created At | URL | Points | Number of Comments | year)
